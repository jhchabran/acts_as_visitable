Acts As Visitable should be barely usable at this state.

Warning : 
 - I haven't bothered myself with perfs so far, don't expect fast stuff yet

TODO 
  - more named scopes
  - destroying stuff is not handled correctly ( default behavior )
  - no configuration is available ( you might already have a sight model )
  - generators for migrations ( creating the Visit model )
  - optimize finds, VisitorModel#visited is currently way too slow for this kind of usage
  - wrap Visit model declaration inside the library
