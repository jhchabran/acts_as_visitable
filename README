Acts As Seen should be barely usable at this state.

Warning : 
 - The current methods names really sucks / are not consistent, they are subject to heavy changes in a near future.
 - I haven't bothered myself with perfs so far, don't expect blazing fast stuff yet 

TODO 
  - more named scopes
  - destroying stuff is not handled correctly ( default behavior )
  - no configuration is available ( you might already have a sight model )
  - generators for migrations ( creating the Sight model )
  - optimize finds, ViewerModel#viewed is currently way too slow for this kind of usage
